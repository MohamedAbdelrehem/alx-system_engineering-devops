# Shell, Init Files, Variables, and Expansions

This README.md provides an overview of a project completed during the Full Stack Software Engineering program at ALX School. The project focuses on exploring various concepts related to shell scripting, including alias builtins, help builtins, local and global variables, expansions, and special parameters such as `$?`. The scripts are primarily written in Bash 4.3.11(1) and have been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

## Technology Stack

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- Scripts written in Bash 4.3.11(1)
- Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## Files

All of the following files are scripts:

The project consists of a meticulously organized collection of script files, each serving a specific purpose:

- `0-alias`: Establishes customized aliases for enhanced shell productivity
- `1-hello_you`: Greets the current Linux user with a personalized message
- `2-path`: Appends a specified directory to the `PATH` environment variable
- `3-paths`: Determines the count of directories listed in the `PATH` environment variable
- `4-global_variables`: Provides a comprehensive list of all environment variables in use
- `5-local_variables`: Lists both local and environment variables, including functions
- `6-create_local_variable`: Creates a new local variable named `BETTY` for customized scripting
- `7-create_global_variable`: Establishes a new global variable named `HOLBERTON` for broad accessibility
- `8-true_knowledge`: Calculates the sum of 128 and the value stored in the `TRUEKNOWLEDGE` environment variable, followed by a new line
- `9-divide_and_rule`: Performs division on the `POWER` variable by the `DIVIDE` variable, followed by a new line
- `10-love_exponent_breath`: Displays the result of raising the `BREATH` variable to the power of `LOVE`
- `11-binary_to_decimal`: Converts a binary number to its decimal representation
- `12-combinations`: Prints all possible combinations of two letters, excluding the combination "oo"
- `13-print_float`: Prints a number with two decimal places, sourced from the `NUM` environment variable
- `14-decimal_to_hexadecimal`: Converts a decimal number to its hexadecimal representation
- `100-rot13`: Implements the ROT13 encryption algorithm for text encoding and decoding
- `101-odd`: Prints every alternate line from the input, starting with the first line
- `102-water_and_str`: Adds the values stored in the `WATER` and `STIR` environment variables and prints the result
